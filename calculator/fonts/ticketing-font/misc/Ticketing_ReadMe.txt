Ticketing is a monospaced font loosely based on the pixel style lettering of electronic ticketing, designed for clarity when cheaply printed at small sizes. Ticketing, however, has a larger x-height than is often found on ticket type.The glyphs were drawn on a square grid 13 wide by 22 high, though some accented characters are taller or extend below the baseline. The Space is a full character width, but the Non-Breaking Space is set to half the width of the glyphs.
